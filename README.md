# FlowMeter
The FlowMeter allows you to record your subjective experience of Flow according to Mihály Csíkszentmihályi over a period of time. Via a Bluetooth HR chest strap, the FlowMeter simultaneously records your heart rate. The FlowMeter displays the collected data in diagrams. You can upload the data to your Dropbox or transfer it to your computer via iTunes. 

FlowMeter is written in Objective-C and uses UIKit, CoreData and CoreBluetooth. It uses third party libraries to compress the data, upload it to Dropbox and display the diagrams.
